It can be machine-readable, which means that security products can ingest it through feeds 
or API integration. Tactical intelligence is the easiest type of intelligence to generate and 
is almost always automated. As a result, it can be found via open source and free data feeds,
 but it usually has a very short lifespan because IOCs such as malicious IPs or domain names 
 can become obsolete in days or even hours. Itâ€™s important to note that simply subscribing to 
 intel feeds can result in plenty of data, but offers little means to digest and strategically 
 analyze the threats relevant to you. Also, false positives can occur when the source is not 
 timely or of high fidelity.
